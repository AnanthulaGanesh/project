LIbrary Managment System


A Library Management System (LMS) is software that automates and streamlines all library operations, from cataloging new books and managing member details to tracking check-ins/outs, handling renewals, managing fines, and generating reports, making tasks efficient, reducing manual work, and providing quick, accurate information for both librarians and users through features like Online Public Access Catalogs.
